This is my recreation of the classic game 'Snake' in Python! 
It's a pretty basic project, but it's one I've been wanting to tackle for a while and I used the opportunity to learn some of the basics of Python. 
This project uses the pygame package to handle the GUI and the user input, and otherwise involves the usage of many basic Python features.
These include the usage of conditionals, loops, lists (in this case utilized as a queue), imports, functions, and strings, among others.
Basic, yes, I wrote this in a few hours, but this was more for getting familiar with the language and its features as opposed to an actual project (Hopefully coming soon!)
Still, it's here as a general demonstration of my basic Python knowledge.

As for the game itself, I went for as traditional as possible.
It's an 18x18 grid, the speed increases every 10 apples you collect, and the game ends if you run into yourself or into one of the walls (None of that looping nonsense).
Once the game ends, you're given your score and an option to restart or quit.
That's about it, like I said, very classic version of snake.
